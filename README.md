<H1>3.1 Introduction</H1>
We introduced the basic terminology and concepts of object-oriented programming in
Section 1.6. In this chapter, we present a simple framework for organizing object-oriented
applications in Java. Typically, the applications you develop in this book will consist of
two or more classes. If you become part of a development team in industry, you might
work on applications that contain hundreds, or even thousands, of classes.<BR>
First, we motivate the notion of classes with a real-world example. Then we present
five applications to demonstrate creating and using your own classes. The first four of these
begin our case study on developing a grade book class that instructors can use to maintain
student test scores. This case study is enhanced in Chapters 4, 5 and 7. The last example
introduces floating-point numbers—that is, numbers containing decimal points—in a
bank account class that maintains a customer’s balance.
